		"CHERT_START_1": "やあ！初めての打ち上げだな？砂時計の双子星へようこそ。",
		"CHERT_START_2": "ああ。ここで何を？",
		"CHERT_START_3": "クリスマスを祝おう！お祝いのために私は旅人たちを木の炉辺へ帰すのを手伝っているんだ。",
		"CHERT_START_4": "星図は知っているだろう？ここは天文現象を見つけるには絶好の場所なんだ。超新星とかね。",
		"CHERT_START_5": "今日だけで2個見つけた。普通ならすごく珍しいのに、奇妙なくらいだ。",
		"CHERT_START_6": "わかった。",
		"CHERT_START_7": "それで、何か手伝えることはあるか？",
		"CHERT_START_8": "クリスマスを祝おう！お祝いのために私は旅人たちを木の炉辺へ帰すのを手伝っているんだ。",
		"CHERT_START_9": "特にない。いい一日を！",
		"CHERT_START_10": "どういうことだ？私にここを去れと、こんな大事な仕事の邪魔をしたいというのか？<![CDATA[<i>]]>絶対にありえない。<![CDATA[</i>]]>",

		"CHERT_START_10.1": "ところで、私の友人のGabbroはもうそこにいるのか？",
		"CHERT_START_10.2": "いや、まだだ。",
		"CHERT_START_10.3": "ああ！あなたも参加するべきだ。",
		"CHERT_START_10.4": "Gabbroがいないならなおさら私も行かない。まずあいつに尋ねるんだ。それから考えるよ。",
		"CHERT_START_10.5": "わかったよ。それなら、なぜ私がここを去って自分の仕事を放棄しなくちゃならないのか、続けて話してくれ。",
		"CHERT_START_10.6": "なら、Gabbroはすでにそこにいるのか？",

		"CHERT_START_11": "あー、つまりだ、私たちはタイムループの中にいて、太陽は超新星爆発を起こそうとしている。もう何度も見てきた。それに、私はもうあらゆるものを探索し尽くしたから、あなたは家に帰った方がいい。",
		"CHERT_START_12": "はは、面白いね！それなら、知ってることを全部教えてみてくれ。",
		"CHERT_START_13": "宇宙の眼は近くの星系からやってきた種族により発見され、彼らのクローキングフィールドの中に隠された船は未だここに存在する。",
		"CHERT_START_14": "あぁ、ああ…。",
		"CHERT_START_15": "Nomaiも別の星系からやってきたが、最初の種族により眼の信号が遮断されたため、眼を見つけることはできなかった。",
		"CHERT_START_16": "あ、あぁ…。続けて…。",
		"CHERT_START_17": "Nomaiは試行錯誤の末に眼を見つけるためのタイムループ装置を作ったが、侵入者による幽霊物質が太陽系を覆いつくしたときに滅亡した。",
		"CHERT_START_18": "うわぁ。私は、お前が<![CDATA[<i>]]>\"もちろん冗談だよ！ははは！\"<![CDATA[</i>]]>とでも言うのを期待してたのだけど…これは…。",
		"CHERT_START_20": "信じられない…。<![CDATA[<i>]]>何もかもだ！<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_21": "でもわかった、取引をしよう:お前が言ったことをすべて証明してくれたら、私は木の炉辺へ行こう。",
		"CHERT_START_22": "もちろん！私はあなたがこれから問おうとしていることはもれなく知ってる:あなたしか知りえない機密情報、未知のNomaiの技術、そして何か他の技術。",
		"CHERT_START_23": "わかった！どうやるんだ？",
		"CHERT_START_24": "つまりだ、もしお前が本当にタイムループの中にいるというのなら、<![CDATA[<i>]]>私だけが知りうること<![CDATA[</i>]]>を言って証明できるはずだ。",
		"CHERT_START_25": "お前はこう言う:<![CDATA[<i>]]>\"Chert、Jumboマシュマロの発明者を知っているのはあなただけだ\"<![CDATA[</i>]]>。",
		"CHERT_START_26": "それは誰なんだ？",
		"CHERT_START_27": "わかった。それで十分か？",
		"CHERT_START_28": "これは重大な機密事項だ。いつかお前も知ることになるかもしれないが、今のところ私に言えるのはこれだけだ。",
		"CHERT_START_29": "わかった。それで十分か？",
		"CHERT_START_30": "いや、お前は自分を\"全部知ってる\"マンだと言っているのだから、何か新しいものをここに持ってきてほしい。",
		"CHERT_START_31": "要は、未知のNomaiの技術ということだ。博物館から持ち出してくるようなものではなく！",
		"CHERT_START_32": "他には何と言っていたか？他の種族の船がまだここにある、だったな？いいね、彼らの技術の一部もここに持ってきてほしい。それで十分だ。",
		"CHERT_START_33": "つまり、この取引は秘密のフレーズと、未知のNomaiの技術、そして別の文明由来の何か重要なもの、ということか？",
		"CHERT_START_34": "了解。家へ帰る準備をしておくといいよ！",
		"CHERT_START_35": "Chert、Jumboマシュマロの発明者が誰なのかを知っているのはあなただけだ。",
		"CHERT_START_36": "おお、それはウィットなことだ。嘘をついていないなら次のループでそれを教えてほしい。",
		"CHERT_START_37": "わかった、そうしよう。さようなら。",
		"CHERT_START_38": "Chert、Jumboマシュマロの発明者が誰なのかを知っているのはあなただけだ。",
		"CHERT_START_39": "幸運を祈るよ！",
		"CHERT_START_40": "ははは。",
		"CHERT_START_41": "それで、私はすべての証拠を待っているわけだ。",
		"CHERT_START_43": "こちらはNomaiのワープコア。彼らはこれを使ってタイムループ装置を実現したんだ。",
		"CHERT_START_44": "こちらは流れ者の技術。",
		"CHERT_START_45": "このアイテムを見てほしい。",


		"CHERT_START_46": "これで、あなたが求めていたことはすべて完了した。さて、家に帰ってお祝いをしようじゃないか？",
		"CHERT_START_47": "すぐに帰ろう。",
		"CHERT_START_48": "つーまーらーなーい。何か重大なものを持ってくるんだ！",
		"CHERT_START_49": "おおぉ。それはまさしく私だけが知っていることの1つだ。もっとも、もはやそうではなくなったが。",
		"CHERT_START_50": "もちろん！すべてを証明して見せよう。",
		"CHERT_START_51": "わ…私は、言葉を失っている…。待ってくれ、そいつがタイムループを有効にする代物で、なのにそれを接続するワイヤーがどこにも見当たらない…",
		"CHERT_START_52": "<![CDATA[<size=57>]]>なんてことを！戻せ！今すぐ！<![CDATA[</size>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_53": "ああ、動揺するな、Chert。直してくるから、落ち着け！",
		"CHERT_START_54": "うぅ…言うのは簡単だ！いいだろう、深呼吸だ…吸って…吐いて…",
		// "CHERT_START_55": "ともかく…",
		"CHERT_START_56": "これは興味深い遺物だ！その種族の技術の主なコンセプトは光や炎に関係するように見える、そうなんだろう？よくやった！",
		"CHERT_START_57": "そうだ。あれはすべて光や炎に関するものだった。",

		"CHERT_START_57.1": "正直にいうと、こいつは衝撃的だ…。期待してなかったのに…。",

		"CHERT_START_58": "わかった…。お前の勝ちだ。私の世界観は<![CDATA[<i>]]>打ち砕かれた<![CDATA[</i>]]>。そして、もはや私はここで何か重要なことをしているとは思えなくなった。だから…クリスマスを祝いに行こうじゃないか！",
		"CHERT_START_59": "イェーイ！行こう、私の船が近くにある。",
		"CHERT_START_60": "ちょっと待って。船を近づける必要がある。",
		"CHERT_START_61": "ダメだ、私の船は壊れてしまっている。すまない。",
		"CHERT_START_62": "いや、大丈夫だ。お前の船は必要ない。私の船は動くものだから。それじゃあ！",
		"CHERT_START_63": "良い旅を！",
		"CHERT_START_64": "実は…そう。それは私も考えていたことだ。いい推測だ！",
		"CHERT_START_65": "それで、<![CDATA[<i>]]>このことについて真剣に考えているのか？<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"CHERT_START_66": "ああ！それでは本題に入ろうか。",

		"CHERT_START_67": "あと何が残っているか教えてくれる？",
		"CHERT_START_68": "もちろんだ、あと残っているのは…",
		"CHERT_START_69": "お前は私にあのフレーズを伝えてくれたが、それ以外にお前の言ったような未知のNomaiの技術と別の種族の技術を持ってくる必要がある。",
		"CHERT_START_70": "ありがとう、Chert。すぐに戻ってくるよ。",
		"CHERT_START_71": "お前は私にあのフレーズを伝え、そしてNomaiのワープコアを見せてくれた。あとは別の種族の持つ何らかの技術を持ってくるだけだ。",
		"CHERT_START_72": "お前は私にあのフレーズを伝え、そしてNomaiとは別の種族の遺物を見せてくれた。あとは何か未知のNomaiの技術を持ってきてくれるのを私は待つだけだ。",


		// Chert tree
		"CHERT_TREE_1": "やあ！聞かせてくれないか…あのすべての知識をどうやって自分の中で処理してきたんだ？",
		"CHERT_TREE_2": "ただ自分で試しただけだ。大丈夫だよ、Chert。",
		"CHERT_TREE_3": "想像してみるよ…。",
		"CHERT_TREE_4": "ああ、あの流れ者の住人たちというものはどんな感じだったんだ？",
		"CHERT_TREE_5": "ああ、正確に言うならば。",
		"CHERT_TREE_6": "彼らは少し不気味で、目がたったの2つしかなかった！",
		"CHERT_TREE_7": "なるほどそれはまったく異なる見た目だし、少し不気味だな。",

		// Ernesto
		"ERNESTO_START_1": "…",
		"ERNESTO_START_2": "ああ、Ernesto、その輝きは素晴らしい！",
		"ERNESTO_START_3": "やはり始めるにはお前の光が必要だ！",

		// Esker ship
		"ESKER_SHIP_1": "最後に宇宙船に乗ったときをもう覚えていないよ…。",
		"ESKER_SHIP_2": "よし、着いた！お祝いに行こう！",
		"ESKER_SHIP_3": "村の近くに着陸したら教えるよ。",
		"ESKER_SHIP_8": "椅子も持ってきたのか？正気か、Esker？",
		"ESKER_SHIP_9": "ああ！まさか、私にコイツをアトルロックへ置いていけと？",
		"ESKER_SHIP_10": "何でもない。",
		"ESKER_SHIP_4": "さあ行こう！メリークリスマス！",
		"ESKER_SHIP_5": "それで、飛行は終わったのか？",
		"ESKER_SHIP_7": "ああ、着いた！お祝いに行こう！",
		"ESKER_SHIP_6": "いや、でも着陸したら教えるよ。",

		// Esker start
		"ESKER_START_1": "やあやあ！それで、私を木の炉辺へ連れて行ってくれるんだな？",
		"ESKER_START_2": "ちょっと待って、何？なんで知ってるんだ？",
		// I change this line since Esker isn't in the loop yet so maybe Slate didn't say it to the player this loop
		"ESKER_START_3": "えっと…私はここに独りじゃないか？だから、その、シグナルスコープでよく村の様子を聞いているんだ。…そして、Slateがそれを話してるのを耳にしたんだ。",
		"ESKER_START_4": "あぁ、なるほど…。あなたは時々恐ろしいよ、Esker。",
		"ESKER_START_5": "それで…次は？木の炉辺に向かおうか？",
		"ESKER_START_6": "ああ！クリスマスを共に祝ってほしい。さあ行こう！",
		"ESKER_START_7": "ああ、でもちょっとまだどこにも行かないでほしい。私の船を近づける必要がある。",
		"ESKER_START_8": "すまない、Esker。私の船はもう動かないらしい。悪いことに。",
		"ESKER_START_9": "ちょっと待って、まずやらないといけないことがある。",
		"ESKER_START_10": "わかった、待ってるよ！",
		"ESKER_START_11": "じゃあお祝いはないのか？悲しいよ…。でも知ってのとおり、私たちはまだここでキャンプファイヤーを囲んで過ごすことはできる。",
		"ESKER_START_12": "いいね！待ってるよ。",

		// Esker tree
		"ESKER_TREE_1": "メリークリスマス！お前は優秀なパイロットになったものだ。",
		"ESKER_TREE_2": "ありがとう！私でも自分は結構上手くやれてるとわかってる。",
		"ESKER_TREE_3": "Jumboについて何か知ってる？",
		"ESKER_TREE_4": "あー。お前はとても謙虚でもあるね。",
		"ESKER_TREE_5": "誰？なんて？",
		"ESKER_TREE_6": "実は…いや、気にしないで…。",

		// Feldspar note
		"FELDSPAR_NOTE": "さあ、今こそこの忌まわしい場所を離れるときだ。船なしで上手くいくかはわからないが、それでも挑戦してみようと思う。このメモを見つけられるように私のハーモニカを録音した機械を残しておく。\n  \n <![CDATA[<i>]]>- Feldspar<![CDATA[</i>]]>",

		// Feldspar ship
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_1.1": "うわ！あれは私がついて行ったアンコウだ！小さめだから危険かどうかはわからないな。",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_1": "ところで、素敵な船だな！Slateに頼んで私もこんな感じの新しい船を作ってもらおうと思う。村の近くに着陸したら教えてくれるな？",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_2": "もう家に着いた、おかえり！",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_3": "もちろん！知らせるよ。",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_4": "イェイ！乗ってくれてありがとう。お祝いに行こう！",
		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_5": "もう家に着いたのか、ひよっ子？",

		"FELDSPAR_SHIP_6": "いや、まだだ。着いたら教えるよ。",


		// Feldspar start
		"FELDSPAR_START_1": "やあひよっ子！私を見つけてくれて嬉しいよ。この呪われた場所から脱出するのを手伝ってくれないか？",
		"FELDSPAR_START_2": "どうしてアンコウの骨から去ってしまったんだ？あそこは安全だったのに！",
		"FELDSPAR_START_3": "もちろん！さあ行こう。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_4": "どこにも行かないで。船を近づけるから。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_5": "すまない…もう私の船は動かないんだ…私たちはここから出ることはできない。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_6": "あそこはくつろぐにはいい場所だったが、結局また冒険したくなったんだ。小さなアンコウを見かけて闇のイバラから脱出するのに役立つと思った。だから追いかけて、そして…そう…ここに辿り着いたんだ…。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_7": "ツイてない！怖くて動けなかったんだが、どうやら静かすぎてアンコウには私を見つけられなかったらしい。ははは！1つ謎が解けたな！",
		"FELDSPAR_START_8": "うわあ、いや、それは本当にツイてない！",
		"FELDSPAR_START_9": "それで…ここから出してくれないか？",
		"FELDSPAR_START_10": "どこにも行かないで？ははは…。",
		"FELDSPAR_START_11": "あぁ…ここからどうする？",

		// Feldspar tree
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_1": "メリークリスマス！正直に言うと、本当に村が恋しかった。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_2": "ここにいてくれて嬉しいよ、Feldspar。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_4": "ああ、私もだ。偉大な宇宙冒険家になるには、時には待つことも必要なのだろう？",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_5": "それは誰だ？それは<![CDATA[<i>]]>まさしく<![CDATA[</i>]]>あなたのことに思う。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_6": "ああ、そいつは文字通り私のことだ。昔から。",
		// Changed from nephew to be gender neutral since Hearthians have no gender
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_7": "私のいとこだ。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_8": "うーーん、実際、私にはわからないな。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_9": "はっはっは。とても面白い。とっても。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_10": "本当に？それは知らなかったよ、ふむ。",
		"FELDSPAR_TREE_11": "わかった、いやおかしいよ。",

		// Gabbro start
		"GABBRO_START_1": "おお、お前か！最初の打ち上げおめでとう。",
		"GABBRO_START_2": "理由はわからないんだが、私は繰り返し死んでるんだ。奇妙に聞こえるだろうか？",
		"GABBRO_START_3": "ああ、私たちは既にこの会話をしたことがある。",
		"GABBRO_START_4": "ああ、私もだ。私らはタイムループの中にいる。それに気づいているのは私とお前だけのようだ。",
		"GABBRO_START_5": "ああ、そうだな、覚えている。それで…何か問題が起きたんだったな？",
		"GABBRO_START_6": "あぁ。もう一度試してみよう。",
		"GABBRO_START_7": "うーん、理にかなっている。Hornfelsに私は死に続けていると言ったが、信じてもらえなかった。",
		"GABBRO_START_8": "あなたはここでくつろいでいるように見える。ところで、村ではクリスマスを祝おうとしてるんだ。あなたも参加してくれないか？",
		"GABBRO_START_9": "うむむ…どうだろうか。退屈にも感じているんだ、正直に言うと。",
		"GABBRO_START_10": "なんて憂鬱な雨だろうか？",
		"GABBRO_START_11": "けれどその一方で…どこかへ飛んだりお前の船に乗ったりするのも退屈すぎる。",
		"GABBRO_START_12": "そこで考えがある。お前の船を爆破して私ら2人ともを死なせて新しいループを開始してくれ！その興奮が冷めやらぬうちに私は自分の船に戻り、木の炉辺まで飛んで帰れると思うんだ。",
		"GABBRO_START_13": "船ごと大爆発？！気が狂ったか？！いいだろう、やってやろう！",
		"GABBRO_START_14": "ははは、そうだな！<![CDATA[<i>*口笛*</i>]]>",
		"GABBRO_START_14.1": "ところで、博物館に新しい展示品ができたのを覚えてるか？あれに関する<![CDATA[<i>]]>秘密<![CDATA[</i>]]>があるんだ。だが、それについては木の炉辺で話してやろう。",
		"GABBRO_START_15": "それで…私は船の爆発を待っている！早く私を殺して新しいループを開始してくれ。…そうすれば<![CDATA[<i>]]>秘密<![CDATA[</i>]]>を教えてあげよう。さらには瞑想の仕方もついてくる！",
		"GABBRO_START_16": "うーん、問題があって…私の船はすでに破壊されているんだ。",
		"GABBRO_START_17": "もちろん。やってみよう。",
		"GABBRO_START_18": "そいつは運が悪かった。次のループではぜひ台無しにしないようにしてくれよ。",
		"GABBRO_START_19": "いいね！私はここにいるから。",


		// Gabbro tree
		"GABBRO_TREE_1": "やあ！あれは本当に巨大な爆発だった！大丈夫だったか？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_2": "大丈夫だよ、Gabbro。タイムループだから。覚えてるね？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_3": "うーん、死ななくとも連れてこられたと思うんだけれど。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_4": "よかった！私はもうハンモックが恋しいよ。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_5": "ああ？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_6": "この場所に何か不思議な感じがしないか？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_7": "特に何も。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_8": "お前もそう感じているか？どうやらツリーの近くにいる全員のタイムループが変化しているようだ…。おそらくそれはライトアップに使っているNomaiのワイヤーのせいだろうな。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_9": "もっとも、私の単なる推測ではあるが。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_10": "それじゃあ！",
		"GABBRO_TREE_11": "お高くとまらないことだ。少なくとも楽しかったよ！",
		"GABBRO_TREE_12": "<![CDATA[<i>]]>秘密<![CDATA[</i>]]>とは何なんだ？",
		"GABBRO_TREE_13": "そうだ！すっかり忘れていた。あの深宇宙衛星はかつて太陽を覆う奇妙な物体を検出したんだ。だがそれは特定の角度からのみだった。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_14": "ある日、誰にも言わず私はそこへ飛んだところ、奇妙な船を見つけた！Nomaiのものとは違うようだった。まったくもって恐ろしかったので、すぐさまそこを去り、誰にも言うことはなかった。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_15": "だが今や、タイムループの中にいれば恐れるものなんてないんだろう？欲しければその座標を送ろう、お前はいつかそこを訪れたいだろうから。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_16": "ああ、共有してくれ！",
		"GABBRO_TREE_17": "いや、大丈夫だ。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_18": "そうだな、わかるよ！隠しておくのが最善というものもある。まあ気が変わったらまた教えてくれ。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_19": "よし、お前の航行記録にアップロードしよう。船に戻れば登録されているはずだ。",
		"GABBRO_TREE_20": "気が変わったので、その奇妙な船の座標を教えてくれないか？",

		"GABBRO_MEDITATION_1": "瞑想の仕方を教えてくれる？",
		"GABBRO_MEDITATION_2": "もちろん！こうやるんだ…",

		// Hal
		"HAL_START_1": "Hey! Are you feeling nervous about your first launch? I know that feeling! I'm nervous about it too!",
		"HAL_START_2": "You'll be the first astronaut with a Nomai translator. I'm so excited about it!",
		"HAL_START_3": "Hal, can you write down a message in Nomai for me?",
		"HAL_START_4": "I think I'm good, Hal. I gotta go.",
		"HAL_START_5": "What are you doing with this rock?",
		"HAL_START_6": "That's what I'm talking about! Good luck in space!",
		"HAL_START_7": "I'm just practicing my <![CDATA[<i>]]>Nomai writing.<![CDATA[</i>]]> I learned a lot about their language when making the Nomai translator, so I thought I should be able to write in their language.",
		"HAL_START_8": "I actually don't know what their language is called. Whatever... no one else can read it anyway.",
		"HAL_START_9": "True. Good luck with it.",
		"HAL_START_10": "Sure! As you can see, I'm already practicing. So, this must be for testing the translator, right?",
		"HAL_START_11": "Of course. Please write: <![CDATA[<i>]]>\"Dear Solanum, I'm inviting you to the Village to celebrate Christmas!\"<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"HAL_START_12": "That's... uh... <![CDATA[<i>]]>oddly specific.<![CDATA[</i>]]> Are we celebrating something? And it's addressed to who? Ah, actually nevermind.",

		// Hal final
		"HAL_FINAL_1": "Woah, I see now what you meant about celebrating!",
		"HAL_FINAL_2": "Sure, and see what I did with your rock! I used it to invite a living Nomai!",
		"HAL_FINAL_3": "Yep. It's very cool.",
		"HAL_FINAL_4": "UNBELIEVABLE! Wait, stop, maybe it's an illusion? Some sort of hologram technology?",
		"HAL_FINAL_5": "Or am I just dreaming? It's too good to be true!",
		"HAL_FINAL_6": "What do we do next? Maybe ask Hornfels?",
		"HAL_FINAL_7": "S-s-sorry. I'm literally speechless.",

		// Hal rock
		"HAL_ROCK_1": "Alright, here you go.",
		"HAL_ROCK_2": "I know the grammar isn't perfect, but who knows... I might very well be the last living person who knows this language!",
		"HAL_ROCK_3": "Thank you! Bye!",
		"HAL_ROCK_4": "So, what are you going to do with that rock? I'm very curious.",
		"HAL_ROCK_5": "Hmm, maybe I'll show it to a living Nomai.",
		"HAL_ROCK_6": "Ha-ha-ha. Ha-haha-ha.",
		"HAL_ROCK_7": "Very funny.",
		"HAL_ROCK_8": "Sorry, I can't talk with you right now.",

		"HORNFELS_FINAL_7": "The lights are very nice, but I think we are missing a final detail to top it off.",
		"HORNFELS_FINAL_8": "We need <![CDATA[<i>]]>something bright and shiny<![CDATA[</i>]]> to put right on the top of the tree!",

		"HORNFELS_FINAL_19": "What exactly do we need?",

		"SLATE_START_15": "Umm, I'm not sure. You can ask Porphy about it.",
		"SLATE_START_16": "So, what's the celebration plan?",
		"SLATE_START_17": "Regarding the celebration, we need to bring all the travelers back home. I asked Esker a few times to help, but they keep forgetting. It's as if I had never even spoken to them!",
		"SLATE_START_18": "Since it's your launch day and there are no other pilots here, it will be your mission to bring them all back. You can start with Esker, since they're so close by.",

		"SLATE_START_21": "You need to find all the travelers, tell them about the celebration, and bring them back here.",

		"SLATE_START_24": "Okay, thanks for reminding me.",
		"SLATE_START_25": "Yes! It's too quiet around here. We need their music, or else no Christmas magic will ever happen. So...",

		"SLATE_START_28": "Nope, everyhing is clear to me.",
		"SLATE_START_31": "Good. I'll be here if you need me.",
		"SLATE_START_32": "Sure. I'll be here.",
		"SLATE_START_33": "Yeah, I've been upgrading our Little Scouts. If you try yours out, you'll notice it has a little Nomai gravity crystal on it! You can launch it at walls and literally stand horizontally. It's neat, you should give it a try.",
		"SLATE_START_34": "Sounds good!",
		"SLATE_START_35": "Just be careful using it in places where you're not supposed to be standing. That just makes it even more dangerous to fall, so keep that in mind.",
		"SLATE_START_35.1": "I also strongly recommend you don't launch it inside your ship. There's already a gravity crystal in there, I really don't think it's safe to mix artificial gravity fields like that.",
		"SLATE_START_36": "Good point. I'd hate to <![CDATA[<i>]]>blow up my ship!<![CDATA[</i>]]>",
		"SLATE_START_37": "Great job, hatchling! I'm glad all our friends are here and the music is playing.",
